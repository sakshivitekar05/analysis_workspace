Task: Load data and query via pandas

Steps followed:
1. Loaded CSV files from data/raw using pandas.read_csv()
2. Queried user counts by role
3. Queried event counts by type
4. Calculated comments per post
5. Queried application counts by status
6. Queried jobs by company

Reason:
Used pandas instead of SQLite/Postgres because it is lightweight, reproducible, and sufficient for analysis on CSV-based datasets.

Created a reusable pandas script to load and query CampusKul datasets successfully.
